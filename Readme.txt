|    SnailUI is a very small UI that started out as an oUF layout but evolved    |
|    into something far greater. It was designed to have a clean,                |
|    minimal layout that was also user friendly.                                 |
|                                                                                |

|    This addon uses both oUF and oUF_SpellRange so please make sure that        |
|    you have those installed before using SnailUI.                              |
